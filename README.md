# GIS Tools
Basic, all-purpose tools that I can incorporate into larger projects, but work well enough on their own for specific purposes.

**Raster R/W**

Tool that reads through pixels in a raster and adds the point values to a CSV in x, y, z format for rasters where the downloaded CSV is in an x, y grid.
